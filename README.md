Make your KA Lite installation lighter, put a bird on it.

# About
When placed in your KA Lite's installation directory, open start.html for serverless browsing of your KA Lite's videos and exercises. 


# Installation and dependencies
Place this directory in your KA Lite directory, convert all of the .MP4 files in your content directory to .webmsd.webm, and open in the start.html file in javascript.  The file format dependency and the browser dependency can be fixed with a little elbow grease, keep in mind this is a proof of concept.
